# zyumn.ai - Simulations of Randomness, Chaos, and Fractals

Welcome to **zyumn.ai**! This project showcases a variety of interactive simulations focused on **statistical simulations, randomness, and chaos theory**. Our goal is to visually demonstrate complex mathematical and computational concepts, allowing users to explore randomness and chaos through different models and simulations.

**Website:** [zyumn.ai.vercel.app](https://zyumn-ai.vercel.app)

## Overview

zyumn.ai offers users a chance to interact with **simulations of random processes, fractals, and chaotic systems**. The simulations are visually presented and enable users to experiment with parameters to see how they impact the underlying behavior of different models. Each simulation is designed to reveal how randomness, chaos, and fractal structures play a role in both natural and artificial systems.

### Simulations Featured

#### 1. **Monte Carlo Simulation of Pi**
   - A demonstration of how randomness can be used to estimate the value of Pi by simulating random point generation within a square and comparing points that land inside a quarter circle.
   - Experiment with different pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) and compare their effects on the accuracy of Pi estimations.

#### 2. **Random Walks and Brownian Motion**
   - Explore different types of random walk models: **Simple Random Walk**, **Levy Flight**, and **Brownian Motion**.
   - Compare their behavior across multiple simulations, adjust parameters such as number of steps and distributions, and analyze the statistical properties of their final positions.

#### 3. **Butterfly Effect and Chaotic Systems**
   - Dive into **chaos theory** by experimenting with sensitive dependence on initial conditions through simulations like the **Logistic Map** and the famous **Lorenz System** (with its butterfly-shaped attractor).
   - Adjust initial parameters to visualize how small changes can lead to drastically different outcomes, a hallmark of chaotic systems.

#### 4. **Prime Numbers and Statistical Patterns**
   - Generate prime numbers and analyze their distribution, prime gaps, and patterns.
   - Investigate statistical phenomena related to primes, such as the **Prime Number Theorem**, **twin prime counting**, and **Benford's Law** applied to primes.

#### 5. **Fractals**
   - Generate and explore famous fractals like the **Mandelbrot Set**, **Julia Sets**, and **Sierpinski Carpet**.
   - Visualize how complex patterns emerge from simple rules and calculate the **fractal dimension** of these structures using methods like box-counting.
   - Experiment with fractal Brownian motion, iterated function systems (IFS), and percolation clusters to uncover randomness within fractals.

#### 6. **Quantum Random Number Generator Emulator**
   - Experience randomness on a quantum level with a **Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) emulator**, simulating random outcomes based on principles of quantum mechanics and comparing its output with classical PRNGs.

#### 7. **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**
   - Explore genetic algorithms, which rely on random mutation and selection processes.
   - Simulate how different random seeds impact the convergence and optimization of complex solutions.

#### 8. **Markov Chain Text Generation**
   - Generate text using **Markov Chains** and compare the randomness and statistical properties of text generated from different corpora.
   - See how this compares with the output of language models like GPT and BERT.
